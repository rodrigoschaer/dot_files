    "readme": "# hyper-alt-click\nAn experimental (hacky) plugin to allow moving the cursor by alt+clicking in [hyper](https://hyper.is/). Very early in development.\n\n![Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1210785/23743760/cdb010da-04a9-11e7-889f-2af23f3995bc.gif)\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: This plugin is essentially one giant hack due to the limited API provided by Hyper. Use it with caution! Actual support should be added to hyper core. Unless someone finds a better way than this!\n\n# Installation\n\nadd `hyper-alt-click` to `~/.hyper.js`'s plugin list.\n\n```javascript\n{\n\t//...\n\tplugins: [\"hyper-alt-click\"],\n}\n```\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Does it work on windows?\nNo idea, but I don't see why not.\n\n## Does it work in VIM/Nano/Etc...\nNot yet, as it cant seem to handle the new lines. This is possible though in a future version and with more research.\n\n## Why experimental/hacky?\n[explanation incoming]\n",
